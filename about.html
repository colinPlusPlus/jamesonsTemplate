                <p class="about">The owner, James Ward, has over 40 years experience in custom Building and construction. He started out as a Young Carpenters apprentice from "back home in Ireland" that moved to Durham Region at the young age of 21. Four kids and four grandchildren later, they are still in Durham Region and have expanded to new regions where Jameson’s has come to be known as one of the most reliable, respectable honest, family run construction companies in Toronto and its surrounding area. Jameson's clients vary from as far East as Trenton, West as Waterloo, and as far North as the Blue Mountains, but are always willing to go the distance for their clients and spend time heading Northbound.</p>
                <p class="about">James started Jameson’s in 1978 and when his two sons, Robert and James were old enough to swing a hammer, started working for the family business.  Now, both sons are construction professionals and there are custom homes, churches, retail centers, train stations, gas stations and centennial building restorations throughout the GTA that all have their handy work attached to them.</p>
                <p class="about">Customer satisfaction is a high priority at Jameson’s.  You can rest assured your experience will be pleasant with the solid craftsmanship at a fair price.  We would not only be happy to provide you with picture proof, but we would try to customize our testimonial package to clients that have had similar work done.</p>
                <p class="about">We work according to Ontario laws and all employees are health and safety trained, have fall protection, WSIB and WHMIS training to ensure that everyone on site is working safely and that home or property owners will also be safe.</p>
                <p class="about">As a full service construction company, we are able to provide service at all levels from concept and design to construction and project management.
                    We hope to add you and your family to our growing list of happy clients that have become part of our extended family.  If you use us once, you’ll never use anyone else.</p>
